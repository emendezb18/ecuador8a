        <center><h3 class="titulo2">THE ESPECTACULAR ECUADORIAN FOOD</h3></center>
        <p class="parrafo2">I am going to start by saying three typical dishes in Ecuador, the first one is called humitas is a traditional food that was created in the pre-Colombian era, the origin of this dish comes from several countries in Latin America like Chile, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and southern Colombia. This dish is made with fresh choclo that’s pounded into a paste and then wrapped in corn husk before being steamed or boiled in water. 
            Another Typical food in Ecuador is called llapingachos is an Ecuadorian fried potato cake, this dish is made, with onions, spices and stuffed with cheese, this typical food is good with a sauce that name is Salsa de mani and you can eat the Llapingachos in Breakfast, Lunch, and dinner also you can eat with, chorizo sausages, avocados, fried eggs, lettuce, and a pickled red onion and tomato salad.
            
            Another typical food one of the most delicious dishes in Ecuadorian gastronomy is, without a doubt, “locro de papas” (potato stew), a delicious potato stew that may contain cheese and rinds, and which is served along with avocado and toasted corn. It has a creamy consistency and its incomparable flavor makes this soup a true delicacy that should be sampled if you find yourself visiting Ecuador.
