            The Napo River goes all the way through all the borders of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. It also joins the Amazon river which means that the water flow of the Amazon river gets boosted. The Napo River in Ecuador also gives water to the people that live close to the river. There are several tours that go around the Napo river people can visit the river and see that there are indigenous people that live close to the river as they need it for water supply and some used them to move things throughout the river.  In the river, you can find a lot of wildlife which are piranhas, caimans, and giant otters. You can also find a lot of different bird species. If you want to see birds if you are interested in seeing wildlife you should go to the Napo River.
