    The ex-leader of the liberal army and ex-president of Ecuador got assassinated on January 28 of 1912 this for the people that supported the liberal government was devastating as he had been the leader of the army that took down the conservative party in Ecuador and raised to glory the liberal party of Ecuador he had been the president and the ex-leader of the army He was assassinated due to a lynching  he wasnâ€™t the only one that got assassinated by the people his more trusted men also got assassinated the men were his brother his nephew and his trusted general. They were political prisoners they were first assassinated and then burned to death by the people who had them as political prisoners.
    
    This is important to the country and the people because the liberal government was the government that let them free from the conservative government that ruled over Ecuador for a lot of years.
