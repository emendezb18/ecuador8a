        The Andes Mountains are the largest continental mountain range in the world. These  Amazing mountains run through, many countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. The Andes mountain range is 8,900 km long and is the most beautiful in the world but not the largest, the Himalayas are greater in width and height, but the Andes mountain range is larger. According to research carried out by scientists, the Andes mountain range is between 20 and 30 million years old. Scientists also confirm that a tectonic pulse in Latin America formed the Andes mountains.
        
        There is a story that happened in the Andes called the miracle of flight 571. It was a flight that went from Uruguay to Santiago de Chile in Chile while they were flying. The flight crashed and some died but others died later due to the intense cold until some of them survived and from that moment they called it the Los Andes disaster or the miracle of the Andes.
