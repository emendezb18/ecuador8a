        <p class="parrafo2">The Cuicocha lagoon is one of many volcanic calderas in Ecuador, this beautiful wonder of the world is very important for the ecosystem and also for everything but humans cannot swim in it because since there is a volcano the water is very hot but this wonder is surrounded by mountains where the volcano lives. This beautiful Laguna was created 3100 years ago when a rash of the water table occurred. The volcano has not been active since the last eruption, but therefore you can't go to see it whenever you want. It's a tourist attraction in Ecuador, a Latin American country.
