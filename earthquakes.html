        <p class="parrafo2">Earthquakes in Ecuador happen because the tectonic plates move the increase in mobility of the tectonic plates is caused because Ecuador is close to a line of volcanos. In Ecuador, the tectonic plates move 7cm per year to move that distance earthquakes will need to happen so that the tectonic plates can move. In Ecuador. There is a photo that shows how much damage it could cause and earthquakes to a city. You could go to one of the places that got most affected by the most recent earthquake so you could go to one of the destroyed cities and look at how much damage an earthquake can make. You can go to a city where cities got destroyed by the earthquake.
