        <p class="parrafo2">The Andean condor is really important because it is the national animal, and it also has a lot of beliefs and myths related to it. The condor, as the name says, lives in the Andes, but it also lives in other high mountains. The condor comes from a family of vultures that just like others share aspects like the beaks, feathers, and wings. If you want to try and see an Andean condor you could go to a mountain that has a high altitude it has to be from 3000 to 5000 m to find an Andean Condor. If you go on a hike to a really high mountain and if you have luck you may find a Condor. There is a park named Condor park where you can go and watch a condor.
