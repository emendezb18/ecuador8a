        <p class="parrafo2">The Cotopaxi volcano is a volcano located in the center of the Cordillera of Ecuador. This volcano is among the highest volcanoes in the world, and the volcano is 5,911 Meters high. The volcano looks like a perfect cone, but it is  interrupted by a small cone in the volcano. Some people of Ecuador sometimes call the volcano “La cabeza del Inca”. 

            This volcano has had one really violent eruption, that happened in January of 2016. The eruption resulted in about a 1000 deaths and millions of dollars wasted in repairing damages that the volcano left behind. 
            The places that are close to the area have also been struck by other natural disasters such as earthquakes, ash sent by the volcano and it has been buried by leftovers of the volcano. 
            The zone around the volcano is also protected by the Cotopaxi National Park, so collect the things you need and be ready to go to the Park to watch the volcano and what it can do to the nearby environment.
